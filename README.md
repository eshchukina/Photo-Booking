Photo Planner app for photographers

Our application is designed to streamline and simplify the process of booking and managing photo sessions for photographers. It empowers photographers to
effortlessly organize their work, manage client information, and provide comprehensive session details to their clients, all within a single, user-friendly platform.

Key Features:

Location Management:
Photographers can create and maintain a list of photo session locations, which can include outdoor settings, studios, or any other places suitable for a photo shoot.

Studio Listings:
For photographers who utilize studios, the app allows the creation of a studio directory. They can add essential details such as studio availability, rental costs, and location.

Client Database:
The application provides a client management system where photographers can store client information securely. This feature is ideal for organizing contact details, preferences, and session history.

Session Card Generation:
One of the app's standout features is the ability to generate a comprehensive "session card." This card compiles all the essential information about a specific photo session, making it easy for photographers 
to keep track of session details and for clients to receive a full overview of their upcoming photo session.

Client Sharing:
The generated session card can be effortlessly shared with clients. This eliminates the need to manually communicate session details, as all relevant information is conveniently included in the card.

Advantages:
Time-Saving: The application significantly reduces the time and effort photographers spend on managing bookings, communicating session details, and organizing client data.
Professionalism: The session cards enhance the professional image of photographers, offering clients a well-structured overview of their sessions.
In summary, our React Native application is an indispensable tool for photographers, making the process of booking, managing, and communicating photo session details smoother and more
efficient than ever. With features such as location management, studio listings, client databases, and session card generation, photographers can elevate their professionalism and offer clients a 
seamless and convenient booking experience. Say goodbye to manual administrative tasks and enjoy the benefits of our comprehensive photo session booking app.
